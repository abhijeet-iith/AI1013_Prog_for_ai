# AI1013_Prog_for_ai

This repo has my work from the *Programming for AI* course at IIT Hyderabad. It was one of the first AI courses I took, and I really enjoyed it.

I learned many cool things like how to build neural networks, do clustering, and solve problems using optimization and logic. The assignments were fun and helped me understand how AI works in real life.

Overall, it was a great learning experience and a good start to my AI journey.
